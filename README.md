# Classification
Projects based on multiple supervised classification methods

## Pathrise
Pathrise is an online mentorship program that helps job seekers get the best possible jobs in the technology sector. There is a data challenge assignment where the main goal of the analysis is to gain insight into whether a fellow will eventually be placed at a company and how long it typically takes to be placed.

This task is based on a data set consisting of 2544 entries with 14 features that refer to the fellows from the moment they entered the program. It is known that 5% of the values in the dataset are missing due to various reasons during the data collection process.

In order to analyze the dataset, I need to understand and preprocess the dataset. Then I will apply three supervised classification algorithms including:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM),
- Decision Tree,
- Random Forest. 
I will then compare their results and take the best one for my study.
